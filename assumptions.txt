- Tests' probabilities (sensitivities, specificities) independent of previous tests.
- Probabilities for a year independent of previous years results.
- No EC survival
- All remaining non-hysterectomy lynch undergo prophylactic surgery at exactly 40 years old (recommendation for lynch).
- Lynch other death probabilities (and many others) equal to non-lynch.
- Other death probabilities taken from cervix model.
- Due to markov limitations, all false negatives are reintroduced in the screening strategy along the true negatives, no distinction made.
- Cancer death modeled with exponential distribution, hence conditional probability of survival is independent of years survived previously.
- Bleeding and asymptomatic are separate populations, they never interact.
- Bleeding current practice assumes evaluation in 12 months (not 6).
